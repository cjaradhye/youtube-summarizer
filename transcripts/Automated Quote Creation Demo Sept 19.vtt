00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.360
Hello everyone and thank you for taking
the time to join us today.

5b84b5ea-4540-42ee-8a56-42e90bb058fa-0
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm excited to walk you through our
automated code creation or AQC solution.

e8fa9d67-43ab-476e-91d0-8e8d6bad59e2-0
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.350
Let's dive into how this tool is
transforming the way we manage codes at

e8fa9d67-43ab-476e-91d0-8e8d6bad59e2-1
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.640
CBRE.

d0e42b04-bfb7-4411-8a72-f38880a6946a-0
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.307
At CBRE,
we understand that efficiency and

d0e42b04-bfb7-4411-8a72-f38880a6946a-1
00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:21.960
accuracy are critical to delivering high
quality reports.

953d29e1-1cf6-46de-8955-dfe9d4729621-0
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.076
Currently,
appraisers must navigate a manual and

953d29e1-1cf6-46de-8955-dfe9d4729621-1
00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:31.960
time consuming process to cross check and
validate client requirements or crucial

953d29e1-1cf6-46de-8955-dfe9d4729621-2
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.840
information which can take upto or more
than 45 minutes per report.

d9076bc8-eabe-4f5e-bfda-5988dbc68ff2-0
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.120
This method also introduces the risk of
missed requirements and mix UPS.

e86d3877-3217-4bbb-989b-8babd4928bba-0
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.060
A solution uses AI powered automation to
streamline the validation process,

e86d3877-3217-4bbb-989b-8babd4928bba-1
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.080
significantly reducing time and
minimizing errors.

66a7e6f4-93c6-4b3c-a78b-1a60118f718d-0
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.173
With this solution,
we expect to cut the time on each report

66a7e6f4-93c6-4b3c-a78b-1a60118f718d-1
00:00:54.173 --> 00:00:54.920
substantially.

4cf1d43a-558b-48b6-be12-a201b4497e74-0
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.353
This not only accelerates our operations,
but also improves accuracy,

4cf1d43a-558b-48b6-be12-a201b4497e74-1
00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:02.320
reducing the chances of errors or
overlook details.

e891ba75-f5c1-4950-812e-7869e8324b05-0
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.064
Ultimately,
this efficient workflow allows appraisers

e891ba75-f5c1-4950-812e-7869e8324b05-1
00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:10.531
to focus on higher value tasks,
driving enhanced client satisfaction and

e891ba75-f5c1-4950-812e-7869e8324b05-2
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:12.000
operational performance.

87a6f450-ad27-4217-b3ff-efba6b312c09-0
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.280
Now let me walk you through how the AQC
tool works in practice.

252b783c-b487-4bfb-aec7-5b9b8060b7a3-0
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.734
When an unstructured mail is sent with
key details such as job information,

252b783c-b487-4bfb-aec7-5b9b8060b7a3-1
00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:27.382
the originator property information,
and client info,

252b783c-b487-4bfb-aec7-5b9b8060b7a3-2
00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.760
the AQC tool intelligently extracts these
fields.

a37e3565-276d-4619-9f69-dc57accc1ab3-0
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.770
Once processed,
the system immediately generates a code

a37e3565-276d-4619-9f69-dc57accc1ab3-1
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.855
and sends an automatic success
notification back to the user,

a37e3565-276d-4619-9f69-dc57accc1ab3-2
00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:43.600
which includes the code ID and the
details of successful code creation.

52989861-2044-4b24-a01c-8e9305f68ecd-0
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.960
Users can then track code's progress by
accessing the AQC Tracker dashboard.

d108f0cc-23b6-463e-b5cd-59aacafb5b62-0
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.095
Using the generated code ID,
they can quickly navigate to the

d108f0cc-23b6-463e-b5cd-59aacafb5b62-1
00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:55.080
activation page.

0cd83408-533d-4ea9-ba74-b990d4a5c39e-0
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.440
At the activation page,
the system auto populates the Code Basic

0cd83408-533d-4ea9-ba74-b990d4a5c39e-1
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.600
task with key information extracted from
the original e-mail.

8fbf988f-db67-465c-b56f-3fe565f3acd2-0
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.000
Users can then modify or update any
details as necessary.

04ab1a8f-b73f-498f-b89c-e1683ac5d38d-0
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.438
Once this information is verified,
the task can be completed by simply

04ab1a8f-b73f-498f-b89c-e1683ac5d38d-1
00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:14.720
clicking the Next button.

b648e84c-f7f2-4669-95d1-12dda6be31bf-0
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.338
Upon completion,
all clients information and other

b648e84c-f7f2-4669-95d1-12dda6be31bf-1
00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:21.680
critical details are automatically
updated in the system.

6438076c-9a66-4046-9ec7-40e664aa602a-0
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.232
Users can instantly view the status
originator and any other relevant details

6438076c-9a66-4046-9ec7-40e664aa602a-1
00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.921
of the code,
ensuring everything is accurate and ready

6438076c-9a66-4046-9ec7-40e664aa602a-2
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:34.800
for follow up or next steps.

c5811ea7-ee05-4c30-9623-1223ee65cbb0-0
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.221
From May 2024 until now,
AQC has successfully generated 89 quotes,

c5811ea7-ee05-4c30-9623-1223ee65cbb0-1
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:46.480
achieving a success rate of over 70%.

54b7461d-6b59-4371-942f-3a8f12886c55-0
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.840
The automation has drastically reduced
the time required for key tasks.

7ceff6d0-b39f-463b-9001-fcff0cb58ff6-0
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.013
The quote basic task,
which previously took much longer,

7ceff6d0-b39f-463b-9001-fcff0cb58ff6-1
00:02:55.013 --> 00:03:00.100
is now completed in less than 10 seconds,
while filling in the contact details has

7ceff6d0-b39f-463b-9001-fcff0cb58ff6-2
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.920
been reduced to almost only one 5.
6 seconds.

df2d0d9f-8cc4-4781-9db4-efac056c91e1-0
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.459
The significant reduction in time has
allowed appraisers to focus on more high

df2d0d9f-8cc4-4781-9db4-efac056c91e1-1
00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.863
value tasks and has minimized the
potential for human errors caused by

df2d0d9f-8cc4-4781-9db4-efac056c91e1-2
00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:14.600
manual validation processes.

99bd9f9e-6a2c-49ff-a581-14a39f89aa89-0
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.517
In summary,
we believe AQC has the potential to

99bd9f9e-6a2c-49ff-a581-14a39f89aa89-1
00:03:20.517 --> 00:03:24.080
revolutionize code creation processes at
CBRE.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.640
Thank you for watching and have a nice
day.
