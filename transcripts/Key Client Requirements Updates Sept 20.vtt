us today.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.240
I'm excited to walk you through our key

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.600
Let's dive into how this tool works.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.024
The process starts when the appraiser
uploads the appraisal report document to

f432e27e-2f49-4589-91e9-cdbf70042c40-1
00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:19.880
the DDR UI as shown here.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.428
Once the document is uploaded to the Box
folder,

0ef960bd-f387-4510-9888-ed21cd6176c5-1
00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:27.400
the AI tool automatically kicks in and
starts processing the PDF.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.323
The AI processes the document and
extracts the relevant information based

f6016252-4f46-4374-adbb-0ad8c842f827-1
00:00:33.323 --> 00:00:36.120
on predefined prompts and client
requirements.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.806
This eliminates the need for appraisers
to go through the report manually,

de31fbf1-c7f4-4ae1-b93b-69bbecdd2534-1
00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:43.040
which saves a significant amount of time.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.120
After processing the document,
the AI generates an Excel report.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.996
Once the report is generated,
the appraiser receives an automatic

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.260
This e-mail contains the generated report
and Excel ready for the appraiser to

755e8451-074b-45b4-b9a4-95294444b21c-1

review and verify the information quickly.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.007
The appraiser can then validate the
report against the source material,

1b8ee2ee-d1fc-4319-a39a-8d9012059533-1
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.200
ensuring that the AI has correctly
interpreted the document.

00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:20.120
information and validation status.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.682
The appraiser can easily review the key
information and validated it and confirm

48f88315-e3e4-4143-b6dd-7ed8289a6f3c-1
00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:27.440

It also compares these again the source
data from the Letter of engagement

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200
Each requirement is marked met or not met
to ensure accuracy.
