Hello everyone and thank you for taking
the time to join us today.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm excited to walk you through our
automated code creation, or AQC solution.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.048
When an unstructured mail is sent with
key details such as job information,

b410bc4f-cab1-4399-a292-149cb7773a66-1
00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:21.720
the originator property information,
and client info,

b410bc4f-cab1-4399-a292-149cb7773a66-2
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.120
the AQC tool intelligently extracts these
fields.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.090
Once processed,
the system immediately generates a code

063d09ea-e83e-4458-946f-5702e469b32b-1
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.175
and sends an automatic success
notification back to the user,

063d09ea-e83e-4458-946f-5702e469b32b-2
00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:37.920
which includes the code ID and the
details of successful code creation.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.280
Users can then track codes progress by
accessing the AQC Tracker dashboard.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.415
Using the generated code ID,
they can quickly navigate to the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.720
At the activation page,
the system auto populates the Code Basic

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.880
task with key information extracted from
the original e-mail.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.280
Users can then modify or update any
details as necessary.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.737
Once this information is verified,
the task can be completed by simply

d871afe7-49c2-4137-a791-fe56f3256759-1
00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:09.040

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.618
Upon completion,
all clients information and other

00:01:12.618 --> 00:01:15.960
critical details are automatically
updated in the system.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.731
Users can instantly view the status
originator and any other relevant details

90eb230d-adc3-4221-81fd-b5ece5000424-1
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.434
of the code,
ensuring everything is accurate and ready

90eb230d-adc3-4221-81fd-b5ece5000424-2
00:01:25.434 --> 00:01:27.320
