00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.278
Hi all,
today's objective is to demonstrate the

5934b88d-a8a5-4d78-8900-f486b4e6c6e4-1
00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:08.345
proof of technology demo on what we are
able to do with e-mail tagging for the

5934b88d-a8a5-4d78-8900-f486b4e6c6e4-2
00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:11.360
Connector Pro application for capital
markets.

850d520c-071c-4b39-b762-42d66bfeb112-0
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.579
The objective of this proof of tech demo
is to showcase the capabilities of the AI

850d520c-071c-4b39-b762-42d66bfeb112-1
00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:26.190
engine that can tag clients information,
extract data from emails, attachments,

850d520c-071c-4b39-b762-42d66bfeb112-2
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.967
etc and categorize them for consumption
into key platforms such as Connector Pro,

850d520c-071c-4b39-b762-42d66bfeb112-3
00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:39.330
which will allow us to avoid manual
efforts and repurpose towards other high

850d520c-071c-4b39-b762-42d66bfeb112-4
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.240
value work.

22ff1028-fc09-4f0c-acfb-7bfcfc4b6272-0
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.530
The scope for this proof of tech is to
sync up user emails with corresponding

22ff1028-fc09-4f0c-acfb-7bfcfc4b6272-1
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.118
Salesforce accounts by installing a
Salesforce Outlook plugin and then to

22ff1028-fc09-4f0c-acfb-7bfcfc4b6272-2
00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:59.159
deploy an AI engine to scan the emails
from Salesforce user account and extract

22ff1028-fc09-4f0c-acfb-7bfcfc4b6272-3
00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.614
the data and loop it back into Salesforce
to create tasks,

22ff1028-fc09-4f0c-acfb-7bfcfc4b6272-4
00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:06.559
notes or chatter posts in this process.

83209d5a-710a-4a52-afae-b275baf64a6f-0
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.040
So how do we get started?

80cf9bf7-b977-46a8-8d0a-742b26932b84-0
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.720
We install the Salesforce plugin on
Outlook apps.

59f0d12e-fb4c-40c7-b727-c4a42d24f44e-0
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.020
The next step would be to see the
Salesforce plugin in action.

53f195a1-6c82-4a7a-b1b0-2c599a33749b-0
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.160
Where the Outlook plugin will sync up the
emails to the user Salesforce account.

dc855984-42a8-41f7-b92f-ab9c27344932-0
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.444
So I go to my mailbox,
I search for the e-mail based on some of

dc855984-42a8-41f7-b92f-ab9c27344932-1
00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:38.372
the keywords that I know and as you can
see I'm opening the e-mail and I'm

dc855984-42a8-41f7-b92f-ab9c27344932-2
00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:41.000
running the plugin which I've installed.

1b2b7462-6dea-47db-a34b-abb48cd1ba1d-0
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.928
As you can see,
I'm using this profile and it is already

1b2b7462-6dea-47db-a34b-abb48cd1ba1d-1
00:01:48.928 --> 00:01:56.002
extracted the contact information about
who's the sender, who's the receiver,

1b2b7462-6dea-47db-a34b-abb48cd1ba1d-2
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.360
what account and so forth.

a8e2e9c6-b4e6-4961-a650-128f2fa337fd-0
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.054
Now we're logging in and this category
has been added and the e-mail has also

a8e2e9c6-b4e6-4961-a650-128f2fa337fd-1
00:02:03.054 --> 00:02:05.440
been added to Salesforce through the
plugin.

6bd90e86-0c92-4979-ae63-a86dbef37601-0
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.461
Now the next step is we are viewing the
tagged e-mail on Salesforce Sandbox where

6bd90e86-0c92-4979-ae63-a86dbef37601-1
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:16.360
the user logs into the Salesforce and
triggers a scan e-mail function.

9e6d66c6-399f-4e95-a925-585d1123cd73-0
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.672
As you can see,
the account is mapped out upon our

9e6d66c6-399f-4e95-a925-585d1123cd73-1
00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:21.400
residency.

11f1605b-8190-4643-97dc-ba4b5d780b2c-0
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.222
We can see that the e-mail is also there,
but there are no additional activities or

11f1605b-8190-4643-97dc-ba4b5d780b2c-1
00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:30.720
open activities that have been captured
because the e-mail is not scanned yet.

598c77a9-b5e0-4bf9-989c-d66e624baefb-0
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.666
So we click on the e-mail,
we open it and we are able to see the

598c77a9-b5e0-4bf9-989c-d66e624baefb-1
00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.200
e-mail which has been extracted.

a40f55b9-c5da-4a2b-9115-e87f08efeb57-0
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.490
We run the scan e-mail function and in
the back end you can see the AI engine

a40f55b9-c5da-4a2b-9115-e87f08efeb57-1
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.838
extracting and categorizing the
information which then is pushed back and

a40f55b9-c5da-4a2b-9115-e87f08efeb57-2
00:02:53.838 --> 00:02:56.240
looped back into Salesforce.

b2eedab0-0367-4636-a9cc-0797a646c95d-0
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.312
So when I go back and see my account
details,

b2eedab0-0367-4636-a9cc-0797a646c95d-1
00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:03.840
you will see that there are two new open
activities that have been added.

525c3a89-64f6-4da8-a535-c4af11b1c9c7-0
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.340
One is a task with the checkbox and the
other one is an activity and you can

525c3a89-64f6-4da8-a535-c4af11b1c9c7-1
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.120
further edit it as per your needs at that
point.

046b8e3c-1d81-4312-a2ed-cc359c3a45fd-0
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.717
Now all of this will be automated,
but we're currently showing the proof of

046b8e3c-1d81-4312-a2ed-cc359c3a45fd-1
00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:20.080
tech.

5b3861a2-7c2e-4aad-a4f9-82d445f7b6cf-0
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.482
So now I go I look into my accounts now
this since it's upper in our residency,

5b3861a2-7c2e-4aad-a4f9-82d445f7b6cf-1
00:03:25.482 --> 00:03:27.080
I'm looking at the accounts.

7fbabfe1-4aa1-41f0-abb6-456424d91716-0
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.779
The beauty is I'm able to access chat out
and I'm able to tag relevant groups and

7fbabfe1-4aa1-41f0-abb6-456424d91716-1
00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:38.440
give them like information or like pull
them into the conversation.

afae6695-bae6-4ea4-bda6-16906e4bb4bd-0
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.440
So what have we solved so far?

d4e332ee-0cde-4b36-acd3-c384078b1068-0
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.154
So with the current progress made,
we're able to prove that the AI engine's

d4e332ee-0cde-4b36-acd3-c384078b1068-1
00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:51.387
capability to extract relevant
information from emails that have been

d4e332ee-0cde-4b36-acd3-c384078b1068-2
00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:53.080
ingested through the plugin.

dbb46686-73f5-4c3d-a0bb-ba32422e4e84-0
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.760
We're able to extract that information.

07c3c18a-349e-4407-abfb-74e86af00e49-0
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.224
We're also able to loop that information
back into the Salesforce application and

07c3c18a-349e-4407-abfb-74e86af00e49-1
00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:06.360
then further on create Tasks and Chatter
posts and Tag groups, relevant groups.

d5c66413-2d16-4ce7-ab49-98e6c920fabc-0
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.278
So thanks for watching this proof of tech
demo and looking forward to the next

d5c66413-2d16-4ce7-ab49-98e6c920fabc-1
00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:13.640
steps.
