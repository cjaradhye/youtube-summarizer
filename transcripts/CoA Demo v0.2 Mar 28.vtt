00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.280
Hi all.

c3e434fb-188c-4cd4-a7ef-d7d254e4c218-0
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.257
Today's objective is to showcase how we
are using machine learning models to

c3e434fb-188c-4cd4-a7ef-d7d254e4c218-1
00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:12.637
enhance the productivity and efficiency
of business operations teams working on

c3e434fb-188c-4cd4-a7ef-d7d254e4c218-2
00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.520
charter of accounts mapping.

50684eb4-6d84-4f35-99be-b3b9e5a3b40d-0
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.226
Currently,
the fund and property transaction

50684eb4-6d84-4f35-99be-b3b9e5a3b40d-1
00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:21.428
accounting,
specifically the chart of accounts

50684eb4-6d84-4f35-99be-b3b9e5a3b40d-2
00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:26.880
mapping processes, are done manually,
which leads to errors and inefficiencies.

f06f0c17-3318-4725-9c5f-6c6fa80c345e-0
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.806
The objective of this project is to
streamline and enhance the efficiency of

f06f0c17-3318-4725-9c5f-6c6fa80c345e-1
00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:39.705
fund and property transaction accounting,
specifically aimed at charter of accounts

f06f0c17-3318-4725-9c5f-6c6fa80c345e-2
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:44.690
mapping processes using AIML techniques,
reducing errors and improving

f06f0c17-3318-4725-9c5f-6c6fa80c345e-3
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.676
efficiencies while accelerating
standardization and reconciliation for

f06f0c17-3318-4725-9c5f-6c6fa80c345e-4
00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:50.800
CBRE operations.

6208a006-1999-4ead-a7b4-a8f3d91be363-0
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.050
The scope of the application is to
implement a user friendly UI for business

6208a006-1999-4ead-a7b4-a8f3d91be363-1
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.593
operation teams to upload files and for
the mill model to predict mappings

6208a006-1999-4ead-a7b4-a8f3d91be363-2
00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:08.880
between source and target accounting
codes automatically.

2bbfe4c5-c17f-4a7e-80f1-949223105647-0
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.558
We are also doing a human in the loop
which provides an option for the team to

2bbfe4c5-c17f-4a7e-80f1-949223105647-1
00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:20.770
manually edit for optimization and
enabling the mill OPS for continuous

2bbfe4c5-c17f-4a7e-80f1-949223105647-2
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.680
model upgrade as a function additional
data overtime.

df990c9c-7365-4280-83ad-9f272788ac6a-0
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
We followed an iterative approach to
solve for the challenge.

4c52b970-1055-44e0-98fb-323df37a6533-0
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.193
As the initial first step,
we analyzed the data provided by the

4c52b970-1055-44e0-98fb-323df37a6533-1
00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:38.000
business operations team and got
clarifications on the same.

3cb43b17-7e42-4439-be76-cfb2dc754fbc-0
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.601
For two to Step 4,
we evaluated multiple models and

3cb43b17-7e42-4439-be76-cfb2dc754fbc-1
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:48.573
approaches to determine which best suits
for effectively addressing the problem

3cb43b17-7e42-4439-be76-cfb2dc754fbc-2
00:01:48.573 --> 00:01:49.320
statement.

ced9ae7b-4d50-407e-99a8-10e54fea113b-0
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.268
Once the model and the outcome was
finalized,

ced9ae7b-4d50-407e-99a8-10e54fea113b-1
00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:58.060
we demonstrated the application to
selected operation team members to

ced9ae7b-4d50-407e-99a8-10e54fea113b-2
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.920
experience the application and test the
same during the same timeline.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.944
We also get the approach and solution
reviewed by the data science teams and

08d74bd1-8e95-4d8c-b23f-fdb7cb1a2c70-1
00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:11.120
enterprise architect groups.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.360
The UI is built on existing CBRE Data
Portal application.

931981be-eead-417b-ba3b-079f01e96823-0
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.692
The interface allows the user to upload
an Excel file containing the Source GL

931981be-eead-417b-ba3b-079f01e96823-1
00:02:26.692 --> 00:02:29.240
and Source description columns.

7f65d95e-11f8-4ffb-9b23-d4149b6009bb-0
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.951
Upon selecting the sheet where the input
data is kept,

7f65d95e-11f8-4ffb-9b23-d4149b6009bb-1
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:43.106
user submits the Excel file for the model
to predict CBREI mapping and CBREI GL

7f65d95e-11f8-4ffb-9b23-d4149b6009bb-2
00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:48.799
NAME for all the rows in the uploaded
Excel and displays it for the user.

0d3d5322-f8d4-4029-b5f6-7729e1c3cc08-0
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.055
By clicking on Download Data,
users can see mapping created by the Mill

0d3d5322-f8d4-4029-b5f6-7729e1c3cc08-1
00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:03.600
model.

01308c4e-0be2-40ed-9ba0-01bdbd1b4e42-0
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.876
The application allows the user to
download mapping files,

01308c4e-0be2-40ed-9ba0-01bdbd1b4e42-1
00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:12.200
both GL and description files,
individually.

4d315c0a-8346-4560-bc7f-7f0aa8b2713e-0
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.077
In addition to this,
the web application also allows to edit

4d315c0a-8346-4560-bc7f-7f0aa8b2713e-1
00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:27.109
the data if there is an appropriate GL
description which fits the mapping and

4d315c0a-8346-4560-bc7f-7f0aa8b2713e-2
00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:33.141
this feature allows human in the loop
intervention for better data quality to

4d315c0a-8346-4560-bc7f-7f0aa8b2713e-3
00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:34.920
downstream application.

ea13325e-c155-4599-afb5-6c9b2c05683a-0
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.920
Whenever user edits the data.

72f04496-4041-4220-bbfb-c10a7986d575-0
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.640
The same can be saved for future training
of the model.

47f8a16b-1fab-40d0-919f-de692204d752-0
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.469
The application is currently under
testing and is being tested by the

47f8a16b-1fab-40d0-919f-de692204d752-1
00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:48.720
operations team.

5d5a8a49-2ba9-4088-98b2-3a2b405a0736-0
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.876
We have set up the ML OPS for continuous
training of new data for model

5d5a8a49-2ba9-4088-98b2-3a2b405a0736-1
00:03:54.876 --> 00:03:55.880
improvements.

4fd198a6-7627-46d0-a5cc-044736471e83-0
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.208
The newly created models will
automatically be deployed and users can

4fd198a6-7627-46d0-a5cc-044736471e83-1
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.880
see the improvements in accuracy of the
predictions.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.340
We are setting up governance models to
capture model performance and seek

9bfe55f8-ccf8-4757-b91e-ece2a0ac19a3-1
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.440
suggestions from the business users for
continuous improvement.
