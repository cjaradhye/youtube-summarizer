00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.315
Hello everyone,
let's look at a quick demo of our NTL

bb44ce53-1b0c-4566-bb11-e4a66223bd57-1
00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:03.600
tool.

d4a8ac60-4301-4336-b454-936a195174a6-0
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.489
Lead generation is a significant task for
our leasing business brokers,

d4a8ac60-4301-4336-b454-936a195174a6-1
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.425
often involving extensive time spent
scrolling through online news feeds to

d4a8ac60-4301-4336-b454-936a195174a6-2
00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:13.720
identify potential leads.

08b0e1a2-23b1-4dda-8d3b-fbfc9c73d1cc-0
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.147
Our NTL tool streamlines this process by
automating the search and analysis of the

08b0e1a2-23b1-4dda-8d3b-fbfc9c73d1cc-1
00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:19.840
latest news.

2125a994-cab3-4667-85e3-cbba9461877d-0
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.807
It employs cutting edge generative AI and
state-of-the-art LLMS to go through

2125a994-cab3-4667-85e3-cbba9461877d-1
00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:26.200
information efficiently.

c06c670a-e21d-47de-ac57-4a40af828e44-0
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.567
It displays a curated list of potential
leads directly to our brokers,

c06c670a-e21d-47de-ac57-4a40af828e44-1
00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:35.640
thus significantly saving time and
enhancing their productivity.

732700ff-a22a-4b98-a440-5cbf886f746d-0
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.938
Currently for this task,
Alphasense is a license tool being used

732700ff-a22a-4b98-a440-5cbf886f746d-1
00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:42.600
by our research teams in US.

8d38d687-24f0-4642-94ff-0239be3a8337-0
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.600
But there is a catch here.

567a4048-767c-4dd2-ae0f-a4c1e353f078-0
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.309
Alphasense requires a lot of post
processing efforts to Polish the results

567a4048-767c-4dd2-ae0f-a4c1e353f078-1
00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.800
in a way which is useful to our brokers.

67da53ce-0e81-4c40-9691-0dedf5970f07-0
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.880
NTL eliminates all this.

d822d9f3-149f-477f-a9dc-04712867c58c-0
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.849
It doesn't require any post processing
and it doesn't require any licensing

d822d9f3-149f-477f-a9dc-04712867c58c-1
00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:59.360
costs also.

9a9f440a-7a45-497a-b69e-9c840eb44ec0-0
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.200
Now let's see a quick working demo of
this NTL tool.

5ef63616-71eb-436a-a0b0-89483add6ef8-0
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.160
Now let's see how our tool operates.

2b859729-30c5-4d18-a06f-3850cb7020f7-0
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
First you will encounter a drop down menu.

d856585c-63a4-4498-ac4d-5996eaa67c37-0
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.245
Here you have the option to choose a
single client or multiple clients

d856585c-63a4-4498-ac4d-5996eaa67c37-1
00:01:16.245 --> 00:01:19.720
simultaneously or OP to fetch data for
all the clients.

d86bed95-421a-478d-9c65-b11e1f2b3669-0
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
For this demo purpose,
I will select single or multiple clients.

da6f27cb-7d8a-4fa1-96fa-ea16cc921124-0
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.822
Next,
you can specify the type of news you are

da6f27cb-7d8a-4fa1-96fa-ea16cc921124-1
00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:26.520
interested in.

b80b9a50-3f33-4a5a-81e3-e40cdf805d17-0
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.480
For instance,
we will select expansion for our demo.

f2be0e01-6c69-44b2-8668-9f18f5ed87d6-0
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.006
If necessary,
you can also mention other types if you

f2be0e01-6c69-44b2-8668-9f18f5ed87d6-1
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:35.440
want to.

d59729b0-3ee4-4d35-89df-717a1474be7d-0
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.460
And also,
let's say we are focusing on a specific

d59729b0-3ee4-4d35-89df-717a1474be7d-1
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.120
client,
which happens to be JPMorgan in our case.

5404523e-2592-4940-957e-02bc4f3a1dc7-0
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.320
Now you can select in a date range for
news analysis.

64b9fa33-6e55-4ea9-ac77-42b8ee4c5a72-0
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.400
I'll put it from 1st of this month to
20th.

082b4f0f-dd15-4dd7-8f5e-802daf13201b-0
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.970
Once you have set all the parameters,
the tool will take a few seconds to

082b4f0f-dd15-4dd7-8f5e-802daf13201b-1
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.680
process the information and generate the
results.

cb97f5fe-cbc9-4379-a9c4-5cb02f4911f1-0
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.026
As you can see,
it is already connected to Google News

cb97f5fe-cbc9-4379-a9c4-5cb02f4911f1-1
00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:06.640
and it is processing the news now.

117c9a02-4149-446e-9005-f6d2d9f4ffdc-0
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.458
Once the processing is done,
as you can observe,

117c9a02-4149-446e-9005-f6d2d9f4ffdc-1
00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:13.314
the final results are organized in a
table format which can also be

117c9a02-4149-446e-9005-f6d2d9f4ffdc-2
00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:15.640
conveniently downloaded as a spreadsheet.

0d8215dd-d545-4436-b4c5-5ae01a68bb0d-0
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.997
Coming to the future road map of this
project,

0d8215dd-d545-4436-b4c5-5ae01a68bb0d-1
00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:27.160
we plan to automatically identify the
sector which the news belongs to.

a1a3aa16-e162-43c3-8052-8272118dbf09-0
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.225
We also plan to integrate this to our
existing CRM systems and we can also

a1a3aa16-e162-43c3-8052-8272118dbf09-1
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:36.480
periodically push out all these leads on
a predator mined frequency.

d693ec9f-c657-4117-8417-10fb870d2965-0
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.520
Hope this provides you with an overview
of the capabilities of our tool.

8a743183-ac37-45a7-88c1-183386881e01-0
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.520
Thank you for your time and attention.
